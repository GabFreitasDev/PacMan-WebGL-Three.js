Pac-Man WebGL
A classic Pac-Man game rebuilt from the ground up to utilize WebGL through the Three.js library. This project demonstrates how to create high-performance web graphics by leveraging the power of the GPU instead of relying on standard DOM elements.

Features
WebGL-based Rendering: Uses a single <canvas> element to render all game objects, including the maze, dots, Pac-Man, and ghosts.

Three.js Integration: The project is built on Three.js, simplifying complex WebGL tasks like managing geometry, materials, cameras, and scenes.

GPU-accelerated Graphics: By offloading rendering to the GPU, the game runs smoothly and can be easily extended with more complex visual effects.

How to Run
Clone this repository --> 'git clone [repository-url]'

Navigate to the project folder.

Open the index.html file in a modern web browser (like Chrome or Firefox) that supports WebGL.

The game will load automatically. Use the arrow keys to play!
